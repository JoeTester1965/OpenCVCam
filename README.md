# OpenCVCam

Based on [CudaCamz](https://github.com/JoeTester1965/CudaCamz)

# Installation

Tested on Debian 1:6.12.34-1+rpt1~bookworm (2025-06-26) aarch64 GNU/Linux


```console
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install 
```

Streamline hailo install and code / envronment for inference process (separate dir?)


Made dir object detection in hailo-rp5-examples : see if can stuff in there and just python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt and path model

Maybe just move requirements,txt and python file and module? or need to run all in Hailo env
